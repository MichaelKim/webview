# Clipboard Example

Clipboard shortcuts (e.g. Ctrl/Cmd+C, Ctrl/Cmd+V, etc.) don't work consistently across all platforms. On Windows and Linux, they should work by default, but Mac requires additional JS code. This example aims to show how this can be accomplished.

This example requires the Clipboard API which is not supported in Edge Legacy.

- WEBVIEW_WIN: not supported
- WEBVIEW_EDGE: paste requires permissions
